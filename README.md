# STEM Analysis Project

This project analyzes female participation in STEM across Balkan countries (2015–2025) using Python. It focuses on trends, country comparisons, field differences, and basic forecasts.

## Key Insights

- Compare female participation across countries and STEM fields.  
- Track trends over time, especially in Kosovo and Albania.  
- Explore correlations between STEM fields.  
- Predict female participation in 2030 using linear regression.  
- Visualizations include bar charts, line charts, pie charts, treemaps, boxplots, and heatmaps.
